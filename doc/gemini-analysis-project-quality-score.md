# Project Quality Analysis (SOLID Principles)

Based on an analysis of the project against the five SOLID principles of clean code, the project scores a **7 out of 10**.

Here is a breakdown of the score based on each principle:

---

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Score: 9/10**

This is the strongest aspect of the project. The responsibilities are very well-defined and separated:

-   **Controllers** (`html2pdfController.go`): Their only job is to handle HTTP requests and responses. They parse the input, call the appropriate service, and return the result. They contain no business logic.
-   **Services** (`Html2pdfService.go`, `mergePdfsService.go`): They contain the core business logic, orchestrating the steps needed to perform a conversion or merge (e.g., unzip, find files, call converters).
-   **Wrappers** (`wkhtmltopdfConverter.go`): These files have the single responsibility of interacting with a specific external command-line tool. This is an excellent separation of concerns.

This clear division makes the code easy to understand, maintain, and test.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Score: 8/10**

The project is well-structured to be **open for extension but closed for modification**.

-   **To add a new feature** (e.g., "Encrypt PDF"), you could create a new `EncryptPdfService`, a new controller, and a new wrapper for the encryption tool. You would not need to modify the existing `Html2pdfService` or `MergePdfsService`.
-   The URL mapping is the only central place that would need a minor change to add the new endpoint, which is perfectly acceptable.

The service-oriented architecture makes it highly extensible.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Score: 7/10**

This principle is less applicable here because the project doesn't use classical inheritance or a heavy interface-based polymorphic design. However, the code is simple and direct, which avoids the kind of complex hierarchies where LSP violations typically occur. It doesn't violate the principle, but it also doesn't showcase a strong adherence through abstraction, hence the neutral-positive score.

---

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Score: 7/10**

Similar to LSP, this principle is not a major factor in this codebase due to the limited use of interfaces. The project achieves separation through distinct structs and functions rather than interfaces. Because the responsibilities are already so well-separated (SRP), there's no evidence of "fat" interfaces that force clients to depend on methods they don't use. The design is clean and avoids this problem by its nature.

---

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Score: 4/10**

This is the area with the most room for improvement. The principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions (interfaces).

-   In this project, there is **tight coupling** between components. For example, `html2pdfController` directly calls the concrete `services.Html2Pdf` function.
-   A better design following DIP would involve the controller depending on an `IHtml2PdfService` interface. This would allow a mock service to be "injected" for testing the controller in isolation.
-   While the current approach works for a small project, this direct dependency on concrete implementations makes unit testing more difficult and the system less flexible.

---

### Final Score: 7/10

**Conclusion:** The project is well-structured, highly readable, and easy to extend. Its excellent use of the Single Responsibility Principle makes the codebase clean and maintainable. The main weakness is the lack of abstraction (interfaces) between layers, leading to tight coupling. Introducing interfaces would significantly improve testability and adherence to the Dependency Inversion Principle, pushing the score even higher.
